;;; Commentary:

;; Cider Storm is an Emacs Cider front-end for the
;; [FlowStorm debugger](https://github.com/jpmonettas/flow-storm-debugger)
;; with support for Clojure and ClojureScript.

;; It brings the time-travel code stepping capabilities of FlowStorm to Emacs,
;; providing an interface similar to the Cider debugger one.

;; Cider Storm isn't trying to re-implement the entire FlowStorm UI, but the
;; most used functionality.  You can always start the full FlowStorm UI if you
;; need the extra tools.
